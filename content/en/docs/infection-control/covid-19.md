{{% /alert %}}

## Government Mandate
Governor Inslee issued a [stay at home order](https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/proclamations/20-25%20Coronovirus%20Stay%20Safe-Stay%20Healthy%20%28tmp%29%20%28002%29.pdf). What does this mean?  
It does not mean to just stay at home. You may go out walking and get out of the house.
 What is important is keeping 6ft away from others.

{{% alert="What is 6ft away?" color=info %}}
If you're in a store, a good way to measure is two shopping carts away.

If you're going out walking, allow others to pass by instead of crowding them.

## What is Coronavirus
Coronavirus, is any virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae. These viruses are named after the Latin word corona which characterizes the crown-like spikes on the surface of the virus. Along with the current strain causing the global pandemic, there are six other known coronaviruses that can affect humans. Each then is subdivided into four generes, the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta depending on their phylogenic clustering. These viruses include:

OC43|beta|coronavirus|

MERS-CoV|beta|(the beta coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS)|

> People around the world commonly get infected with human coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. 
>
> Sometimes coronaviruses that infect animals can evolve and make people sick and become a new human coronavirus. Three recent examples of this are 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.

## Origination of COVID-19

Coronaviruses (CoVs) originate from animals such camels, civets and bats and cause a variety of diseases in different species. In cows and pigs coronaviruses can cause enteritis, in chickens and humans they cause upper respiratory infections which can potentially be lethal to humans. SARS coronaviruses including COVID-19 are believed to have specifically originate from horseshoe bats.  

The first case of (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 emerged in late December of 2019 after China reported cases of pneumonia in people associated with Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, Hubei Province. By the end of the year, there were over 30 individuals in China with confirmed cases of the virus. Subsequently over the next few months, the virus spread to more than two dozen countries causing sickness and death to thousand of people worldwide. Currently, we are at a global pandemic with majority of the countries and islands around the world fighting against the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Below are some of the countries affected by the coronavirus and their confirmed cases as reported by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
