## Government Mandate
Governor Inslee issued a [stay at home order](https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/proclamations/20-25%20Coronovirus%20Stay%20Safe-Stay%20Healthy%20%28tmp%29%20%28002%29.pdf). What does this mean?  
It does not mean to just stay at home. You may go out walking and get out of the house.
 What is important is keeping 6ft away from others.

{{% alert="What is 6ft away?" color=info %}}

If you're going out walking, allow others to pass by instead of crowding them.
